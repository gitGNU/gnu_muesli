Muesli presents a generic API for calling interpreted languages from a
C or C++ program, allowing the choice of interpreted language to be
left until runtime.

To configure and install it, you should first install the languages
you want it to interface to.

Then run Muesli's configure script.  It will report which of the
languages it has detected.  You may need to do some of the language
installation manually then re-run the configure script.

Then run `make' and `make install'.
